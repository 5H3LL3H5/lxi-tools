=== lxi-tools v1.9 ===


Changes since lxi-tools v1.8:

 * Update README

 * Fix newlines when redirecting to file or terminal

 * Rename --dump-hex to --hex

 * Fix missing error message when no SCPI command defined

 * Update man page

 * Remove --dump-file option

   The correct way to dump response to file is to use pipe output
   redirection. For example:

   lxi scpi --address 192.168.1.210 "*IDN?" > response.txt

   This way it is possible to dump any binary reponse to file.

 * Fix missing error message when no IP address defined

 * Print errors to stderr

 * Cleanup Siglent SDS1000 plugin name

 * Add Siglent SSA 3000X screenshot plugin

 * Cleanup script examples

 * Correct default SCPI raw/TCP port

   By default use port 5025 as described here:
   http://www.lxistandard.org/About/LXI-Protocols.aspx

   If a different port is needed use the '--raw-port' option.

   Apparently Rigol is not using the recommended port for raw SCPI
   commands.

 * Update descriptions of the plugin options



Changes since lxi-tools v1.7:

 * Update README

 * Add Siglent SDS 1000 screenshot plugin



Changes since lxi-tools v1.6:

 * Update README

 * Cleanup

 * Update .regex for Tektronix plugin

 * Update .regex for R&S plugin

 * Update .regex for Keysight plugin

 * Update man page

 * Embed instrument IP address in screenshot filename

   This helps identify screenshot files when capturing screenshots from
   multiple instruments.

   It also allows to simplify the APIs used by the screenshot plugins.

 * Change option '--model' to '--plugin'

   Lets remove any model vs. plugin confusion and only deal with plugin
   names. Each plugin includes support for one or more instruments models
   as described in the plugin description.

 * Add automatic loading of screenshot plugin feature

   If no screenshot plugin is specified the tool will automatically try to
   select the best plugin by matching the instruments ID string against the
   regular expressions defined in each plugin.

   Each screenshot plugin defines a .regex string entry containing space
   separated regular expressions. Each regular expression is matched
   against the instrument ID string. The plugin with most matches is
   selected.

   Note: This mechanism is slightly slower than manually specifying which
   screenshot plugin because it needs to retrieve the instruments ID string
   first.

 * Improve description of Rigol plugins

 * Fix Rigol 2000 screenshot plugin

   Remove trailing newline in received image data.

 * Add screenshot plugin for Rigol 2000 series

   Also, make existing Rigol plugin only apply for 1000z series.



Changes since lxi-tools v1.5:

 * Add date-time stamp to screenshot filename

 * Improve command handling

   In case of a misspelled command the tool would misleadingly
   respond: "Error: No IP address specified"

   With this fix, it now responds: "Error: Unknown command"

 * Update README

 * Added screenshot plugin for Tektronix 2000 series scopes

 * Improve scpi response output

 * Add --raw and --raw-port options to scpi command

   One can now use choose to use raw/TCP instead of VXI11 when firing SCPI
   commands. Simply append the --raw option like so:

   lxi scpi --raw --address 192.168.0.42 "*IDN?"

   By default raw/TCP port 5555 is used but it can be changed using the
   --raw-port <port> option.

   Warning: Using raw/TCP is faster than VXI11 but does not provide any
   timeout/control mechanisms so if your command somehow stalls it will
   stall forever.

 * Use new lxi_connect() function

 * Cleanup

 * Make screenshot filename optional

   In case no screenshot filename is provided the tool will write the
   screenshot image to an automatically resolved and incremented filename
   on the form screenshot-###.<format>. For example, screenshot-000.png,
   screenshot-001.png, etc..

 * Improve screenshot model listing

 * Increase default timeout for screenshot command

   Transferring screenshot image data takes time so lets increase the
   timeout so we do not easily interrupt a good but slow transfer.

 * Collapse Rigol screenshot plugin

   Support all Rigol oscilloscope models via one model name.

 * Add screenshot support for Keysight IV 2000 X

 * Cleanup plugins

 * Add screenshot support for R&S HMO1000 series

 * Add screenshot support for Rigol 2000/4000

 * Create directory for screenshot plugins



Changes since lxi-tools v1.4:

 * Remove -Og flag       

   Not supported by older gcc versions.             

 * Fix various bugs in script and interactive mode  



Changes since lxi-tools v1.3:

 * Add screenshot feature to lxi tool

   The old rigol_1000z_screenshot tool is retired in favor of a screenshot feature
   in the lxi tool. A new lxi command 'screenshot' is added and also a small
   screenshot plugin framework which makes it easy to add new screenshot plugins
   for new instruments.

   Currently there is only a screenshot plugin for Rigol 1000Z series
   oscilloscopes.

 * Update README



Changes since lxi-tools v1.2:

 * Added AUTHORS file

 * Use new lxi_connect() function

 * Reconfigure default timeout to 3 seconds



Changes since lxi-tools v1.1:

 * Increase default timeout value for lxi tool

   Increase the default timeout value for the lxi tool from 1 to 5 seconds

 * Fix timeout for Rigol screenshot tool

   Timeout is increased to avoid failure to capture screenshot

 * Fix typo

 * Cleanup test script

 * Fix crash in rigol_1000z_screenshot tool

   Add error handling to avoid crashing when connecting remote device fails.

   src/bash-completion/lxi is included in the distributed tarball.

 * Update README
