=== lxi-tools v1.6 ===


Changes since lxi-tools v1.5:

 * Add date-time stamp to screenshot filename

 * Improve command handling

   In case of a misspelled command the tool would misleadingly
   respond: "Error: No IP address specified"

   With this fix, it now responds: "Error: Unknown command"

 * Update README

 * Added screenshot plugin for Tektronix 2000 series scopes

 * Improve scpi response output

 * Add --raw and --raw-port options to scpi command

   One can now use choose to use raw/TCP instead of VXI11 when firing SCPI
   commands. Simply append the --raw option like so:

   lxi scpi --raw --address 192.168.0.42 "*IDN?"

   By default raw/TCP port 5555 is used but it can be changed using the
   --raw-port <port> option.

   Warning: Using raw/TCP is faster than VXI11 but does not provide any
   timeout/control mechanisms so if your command somehow stalls it will
   stall forever.

 * Use new lxi_connect() function

 * Cleanup

 * Make screenshot filename optional

   In case no screenshot filename is provided the tool will write the
   screenshot image to an automatically resolved and incremented filename
   on the form screenshot-###.<format>. For example, screenshot-000.png,
   screenshot-001.png, etc..

 * Improve screenshot model listing

 * Increase default timeout for screenshot command

   Transferring screenshot image data takes time so lets increase the
   timeout so we do not easily interrupt a good but slow transfer.

 * Collapse Rigol screenshot plugin

   Support all Rigol oscilloscope models via one model name.

 * Add screenshot support for Keysight IV 2000 X

 * Cleanup plugins

 * Add screenshot support for R&S HMO1000 series

 * Add screenshot support for Rigol 2000/4000

 * Create directory for screenshot plugins

   Not supported by older gcc versions.             

 * Fix various bugs in script and interactive mode  



Changes since lxi-tools v1.3:

 * Add screenshot feature to lxi tool

   The old rigol_1000z_screenshot tool is retired in favor of a screenshot feature
   in the lxi tool. A new lxi command 'screenshot' is added and also a small
   screenshot plugin framework which makes it easy to add new screenshot plugins
   for new instruments.

   Currently there is only a screenshot plugin for Rigol 1000Z series
   oscilloscopes.

 * Update README
