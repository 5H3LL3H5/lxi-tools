=== lxi-tools v1.4 ===


Changes since lxi-tools v1.3:

 * Add screenshot feature to lxi tool

   The old rigol_1000z_screenshot tool is retired in favor of a screenshot feature
   in the lxi tool. A new lxi command 'screenshot' is added and also a small
   screenshot plugin framework which makes it easy to add new screenshot plugins
   for new instruments.

   Currently there is only a screenshot plugin for Rigol 1000Z series
   oscilloscopes.
