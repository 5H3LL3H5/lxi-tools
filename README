=== LXI Tools (lxi-tools) ===


1. Introduction

    LXI Tools (lxi-tools) is a collection of software tools for controlling LXI
    instruments such as modern oscilloscopes, power
    supplies, spectrum analyzers etc..

    The most notable tool is the 'lxi' application which provides commandline
    control of LXI instruments.

    Also available is a small tool for grabbing screenshots from Rigol 1000Z
    series oscilloscopes.

    All tools rely on liblxi for LXI communication.


2. Status

    The code is currently considered experimental. API and internals are
    subject to change. Use on your own risk.


3. Usage

    The commandline interface of the lxi application is reflected in the output
    from 'lxi --help':

    Usage: ./lxi [--version] [--help] <command> [<options>] [<scpi command>]

      -v, --version                Display version
      -h, --help                   Display help

    Commands:
      discover                     Search for LXI devices
      scpi                         Send SCPI command

    Discover options:
      -t, --timeout <seconds>      Timeout (default: 1)

    Scpi options:
      -i, --ip <ip>                IP address
      -t, --timeout <seconds>      Timeout (default: 1)
      -x, --dump-hex               Print response in hexidecimal
      -f, --dump-file <filename>   Save response to file
      -a, --interactive            Enter interactive mode
      -r, --run-script <filename>  Run script


    Example - discovering LXI devices on your network:

     $ lxi discover
     Searching for LXI devices - please wait...

    Example - sending a SCPI command to an instrument:
    
    $ lxi scpi --address 10.42.0.42 "*IDN?"
    RIGOL TECHNOLOGIES,DS1104Z,DS1ZA171206207,00.04.03


    The commandline interface of the rigol_1000z_screenshot application is
    quite simple:

    Usage: rigol_1000z_screenshot <ip> <filename>

    Example - retrieve screenshot:

    $ rigol_1000z_screenshot 10.42.0.42 my_screen.bmp
    Saved screenshot to my_screen.bmp
