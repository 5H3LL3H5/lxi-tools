=== LXI Tools (lxi-tools) ===


1. Introduction

    LXI Tools (lxi-tools) is a collection of software tools for controlling LXI
    instruments such as modern oscilloscopes, power supplies, spectrum
    analyzers etc..

    The most notable tool is the 'lxi' application which provides commandline
    control of LXI instruments.

    Also available is a small tool for grabbing screenshots from Rigol 1000Z
    series oscilloscopes.

    All tools rely on liblxi for LXI communication.


2. Status

    The code is currently considered experimental. API and internals are
    subject to change. Use on your own risk.


3. Usage


3.1 lxi

    The commandline interface of the lxi application is reflected in the output
    from 'lxi --help':

     Usage: ./lxi [--version] [--help] <command> [<options>] [<scpi command>]

       -v, --version                Display version
       -h, --help                   Display help

     Commands:
       discover                     Search for LXI devices
       scpi                         Send SCPI command

     Discover options:
       -t, --timeout <seconds>      Timeout (default: 1)

     Scpi options:
       -i, --ip <ip>                IP address
       -t, --timeout <seconds>      Timeout (default: 1)
       -x, --dump-hex               Print response in hexidecimal
       -f, --dump-file <filename>   Save response to file
       -a, --interactive            Enter interactive mode
       -r, --run-script <filename>  Run script


    Example - discovering LXI devices on your network:

     $ lxi discover
     Searching for LXI devices - please wait...

     Broadcasting on interface lo
     Broadcasting on interface eth0
         Found "RIGOL TECHNOLOGIES,DS1104Z,DS1ZA171206207,00.04.03.SP2" on address 10.42.0.42
     Broadcasting on interface wlan0
     Broadcasting on interface docker0
     Broadcasting on interface lxcbr0

     Found 1 device


    Example - sending a SCPI command to an instrument:
    
    $ lxi scpi --address 10.42.0.42 "*IDN?"
    RIGOL TECHNOLOGIES,DS1104Z,DS1ZA171206207,00.04.03


3.2 rigol_1000z_screenshot

    The commandline interface of the rigol_1000z_screenshot application is
    quite simple:

    Usage: rigol_1000z_screenshot <address> <filename>


    Example - retrieve PNG screenshot:

    $ rigol_1000z_screenshot 10.42.0.42 my_screen.png
    Saved screenshot to my_screen.png


4. Installation
    
    Install steps:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    NOTE: 
     lxi-tools depends on liblxi so you need to go install liblxi first.
