=== LXI Tools (lxi-tools) ===


1. Introduction

    LXI tools (lxi-tools) is a collection of software tools for GNU/Linux
    systems that enables control of LXI instruments such as modern
    oscilloscopes, power supplies, spectrum analyzers etc..

    The main tool is the 'lxi' application which provides commandline control
    of LXI instruments.

    Also available is a small tool for grabbing screenshots from Rigol 1000Z
    series oscilloscopes.

    All tools rely on liblxi for LXI communication.


2. Usage

    The commandline interface of the lxi application is reflected in the output
    from 'lxi --help':

     Commands:
       discover                     Search for LXI devices
       scpi                         Send SCPI command

     Discover options:
       -t, --timeout <seconds>      Timeout (default: 1)

     Scpi options:
